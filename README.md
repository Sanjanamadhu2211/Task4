# Task4
In this task, I implemented a binary classifier using logistic regression on the Breast Cancer dataset. After standardizing features and splitting the data, I trained the model and evaluated it using a confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score. I also visualized the sigmoid function and the ROC curve.

Tools Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – for visualization
- Scikit-learn – for model building, metrics, and preprocessing
